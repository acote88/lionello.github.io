A little Chinese girl had one of <a href="http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/Solar_Fan_Cap.html" title="Solar Fan Cap">these things</a> and now I want one too! It's a baseball cap with a solar powered fan, blowing a nice breeze of 'fresh' air in your face. Interestingly, the fan automatically stops when you enter the shade! That's enough proof for intelligent design right there.
