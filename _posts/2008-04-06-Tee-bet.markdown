I can't help feeling a bit frustrated when reading the coverage of the riots on most 'free' news sites. I will not comment on the issue directly (way over my head), but I do believe <a href="http://www.blackandwhitecat.org/2008/04/01/separatism-and-tibe%74/" title="Seperatism">this article</a> does a great job explaining the frustrations here in China.
