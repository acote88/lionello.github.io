<a href="http://chinadailyshow.com/?p=22" title="The China Daily Show">This</a> should have something for everybody.<br />
```
Just two days after protesting outside Korean bakery Tous Les Jours, French-embittered Chinese mobs took to the streets and burned a Yugoslavian flag, “as punishment for their ignorance!” cried one protester.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Sarcastic chants of “Allo” and “Salut” could be heard over dance mixes of the song “Dragostea Din Tei,” by Moldovan pop band, O-Zone.<br />
“I used to love this song,” said Tang Jingjing. “Those days were gone.”
```
<br />
Funny stuff, I hope they keep it up.
