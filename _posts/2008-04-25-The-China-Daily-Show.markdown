<a href="http://chinadailyshow.com/?p=22" title="The China Daily Show">This</a> should have something for everybody.

Just two days after protesting outside Korean bakery Tous Les Jours, French-embittered Chinese mobs took to the streets and burned a Yugoslavian flag, “as punishment for their ignorance!” cried one protester.

Sarcastic chants of “Allo” and “Salut” could be heard over dance mixes of the song “Dragostea Din Tei,” by Moldovan pop band, O-Zone.
“I used to love this song,” said Tang Jingjing. “Those days were gone.”
