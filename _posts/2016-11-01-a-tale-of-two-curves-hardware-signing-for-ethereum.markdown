All popular blockchains, starting with Bitcoin through Ethereum all the way up to Zcash, use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) for cryptographically signing transactions.
Software implementations are often prone to side-channel attacks that leak
information about the private keys. Luckily, newer devices are equipped with
hardware that supports key generation and signing, but leveraging these new
features for existing blockchains is not straightforward because of the
different algorithms involved.
