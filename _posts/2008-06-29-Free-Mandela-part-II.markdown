Remember <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=S1KGwQ1O88Y" title="Mandela's dead?">this</a> Bush gaffe?<br />
<blockquote>I thought an interesting comment was made — somebody said to me, I heard somebody say, “Now, where’s Mandela?” Well, Mandela’s dead because Saddam Hussein killed all the Mandelas.</blockquote><br />
As if this quote wasn't fucked up enough, now it turns out <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080627/ap_on_go_co/us_mandela" title="Bush gets bill to end blocks to Mandela">Mandela is on the US terrorist watch list</a>. What was he saying? Saddam killed all the terrorists? That's a good thing, right?
