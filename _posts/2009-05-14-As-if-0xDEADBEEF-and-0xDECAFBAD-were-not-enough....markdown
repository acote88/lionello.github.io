Long time no post. My page is still being blocked (I might just as well resurrect that post about Tbet) and having to use VPN to write a post is just too much effort. <br />
<br />
So why this post? I just had to share my latest brainchild with the rest of the world:<br />
```
<a title="Ce faci ba!?">0xCEFAC1BA</a>
```
<br />
Hover the mouse over the text to see its meaning. It's a hexadecimal value that when considered as words is Romanian for "WTF are you doing!". This turns out to be applicable because similar 'magic numbers' are often used to catch software bugs: when the the special value appears, the programmer knows something is wrong.<br />
