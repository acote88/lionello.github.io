Life used to be so simple: you'd watch a youtube clip and as the little round thingy caught up with the end of the reddish line you knew what you were up to: press pause, wait a little while, and continue.<br />
<br />
But now, forget all you ever knew, forget those rules that help you get through the day. Besides, it's free, so stop complaining.<br />

Funny clips, by the way. The one I linked to is not even the funniest, but it's the one I was watching when I got annoyed by the seemingly random "buffering" hick-ups. Be sure to watch more clips by the same author.
