OK, easy indeed:<br />
<blockquote>openssl req -new -key ssl-cert-snakeoil.key -out ssl-cert-snakeoil.csr</blockquote><br />
Again, I've used the primary key generated by dovecot to generate the Certificate Signing Request. Copy-paste into cacert.org, wait, copy-paste from cacert.org into new .cert file on the server and tell dovecot to use this new certificate (easily done from webmin.)<br />
<br />
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> using a private key that you did not yourself create is not secure. Check <a href="http://lunesu.com/index.php?/archives/80-Creating-my-own-certificates.html" title="Creating server keys">this post</a> on how to create your own keys.
