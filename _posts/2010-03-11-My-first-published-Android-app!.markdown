<!-- s9ymdb:69 --><img class="serendipity_image_right" width="195" height="195"  src="http://www.lunesu.com/uploads/qrcode.png"  alt="BeijingAir qr code" />I've just finished my first app and have published it on the market! The app is very simple: it shows the current air quality in Beijing, as measured by the US Embassy. Scan the QR Code on the right and my app will pop up in the market app.<br />
