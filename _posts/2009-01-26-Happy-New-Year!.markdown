Or actually, this year it's <strong>Happy 牛 Year!</strong> 牛 is the character for ox/cow and is pronounced <em>niu</em>, yes, like <em>new</em>. And let me completely ruin the joke by underlining that it's <u>the year of the ox</u>. Get it? Funny, huh?<br />

Anyway, enjoy the fireworks. We had the same kind of view from our apartment last night:<br />

Oh, and my site got blocked! I have to use VPN to access it. Perhaps it's because of my previous post about Tibet, but I'm linking to <em>their </em>freakin' site for God's sake!
