For some reason none of my domains DNS names resolve to IP addresses anymore. I wonder if it has something to do with China's new policy, see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/18/world/asia/18china.html" title="China Imposes New Internet Controls">China Imposes New Internet Controls</a>.

It basically boils down to this: domain names will not be resolved to IP addresses, unless you register your domain (even your <em>foreign </em>domain) with the Chinese authorities.

Now I'm no expert in population control and have to admire the Chinese goverment for their expertise on the subject, but I don't think that the power of the young generation of Chinese should be underestimated. I mean, even when my former colleagues would follow a link to a blocked website they would get mad. Now imagine if suddenly the World Of Warcraft servers would be inaccessible.

For the moment, let's hope this is a temporary glitch in my ISP's DNS service.

<strong>UPDATE: </strong>Screw that, even google.com cannot be resolved. I've just entered the IPs of some US DNS servers in my router configuration. This Chinese DNS service is crap anyway.

<strong>UPDATE2: </strong> I'm now using 8.8.8.8, <a href="http://code.google.com/speed/public-dns/" title="Google Public DNS">Google Public DNS</a>

<strong>UPDATE3: </strong> <a href="http://www.lunesu.com/archives/128-Finally-unbound-+-dnsmasq.html">No I'm not</a>
