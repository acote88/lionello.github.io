<em>John, owner of The Coffee Lobby:</em> How much rent do you pay for your apartment?
<em>Ine:</em> About 400 euros per month.
<em>John:</em> That's not too bad.
<em>Ine:</em> It's good, considering we get 500 euros per month rent from our house in Romania.
<em>John:</em> You have a house in Romania!?
<em>Ine:</em> Yeah, we bought a house in Romania 3 years ago, but couldn't sell it because of a lawsuit.
<em>John:</em> A law suit?
<em>Ine:</em> Yeah, we got sued by our neighbors, and we couldn't sell the house.
<em>John:</em> You have a lawsuit in Romania!?
<em>Ine:</em> Well, not me, my company was sued in Romania.
<em>John:</em> You have a company in Romania!? .... Man, I thought <u>my</u> life was fucked up...

(By some freak coincidence, <em>Hotel California</em> was playing on the background "You can check-in anytime you like, but you can never leave..")
