<em>John, owner of The Coffee Lobby:</em> How much rent do you pay for your apartment?<br />
<em>Ine:</em> About 400 euros per month.<br />
<em>John:</em> That's not too bad.<br />
<em>Ine:</em> It's good, considering we get 500 euros per month rent from our house in Romania.<br />
<em>John:</em> You have a house in Romania!?<br />
<em>Ine:</em> Yeah, we bought a house in Romania 3 years ago, but couldn't sell it because of a lawsuit.<br />
<em>John:</em> A law suit?<br />
<em>Ine:</em> Yeah, we got sued by our neighbors, and we couldn't sell the house.<br />
<em>John:</em> You have a lawsuit in Romania!?<br />
<em>Ine:</em> Well, not me, my company was sued in Romania.<br />
<em>John:</em> You have a company in Romania!? .... Man, I thought <u>my</u> life was fucked up...<br />
