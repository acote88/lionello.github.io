Typical Chinese reaction to a bad habit of mine:<br />
<br />
<something bad happens><br />
<em>Me:</em> Jesus!<br />
<em>Li X:</em> What you say?<br />
<em>Me:</em> Jesus. Do you know Jesus?<br />
<em>Li:</em> Zhisus? I don't know.<br />
<em>Me:</em> You don't know Jesus Christ?<br />
<em>Li:</em> No.. Is it a bad word?<br />
<em>Me:</em> .... Sometimes...<br />
<br />
