After lunch I suddenly got very dizzy and felt like falling off my chair. When this feeling continued for about a minute it drove me crazy and I decided to go for a walk to get some green tea. My boss walked out of her office, looking around and seeming pretty confused, too. I asked her if she felt something, since it seemed we both had a similar inexplicable anxiety. We concluded that it was probably an earthquake. (I think Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome is not <em>that</em> acute.)

I checked <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2008ryan.php" title="US Geological Survey">USGS</a>, which confirmed that there was indeed an earthquake, albeit ~1500km SW of Beijing. A score of 7.8 is indeed a serious earthquake, but I'm still amazed that we were able to feel it at such a distance.

Turns out it was indeed serious. A couple of <a href="http://news.163.com/08/0512/19/4BP13ETF0001124J.html">buildings collapsed</a>, about <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/05/12/china.quake/index.html" title="CNN">100 dead</a>, but that number will surely rise.

It's about time the Olympic Games started. It feels like everybody is keeping their breath, hoping nothing serious will go wrong. The T-bet riots were a nightmare scenario, but by the time the games actually start in August, there will have been other, more worrying issues keeping "the west" busy.

<strong>EDIT:</strong> <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/12/content_8154406.htm" title="Xinhua">5000 feared dead, 80% of buildings destroyed</a>.
