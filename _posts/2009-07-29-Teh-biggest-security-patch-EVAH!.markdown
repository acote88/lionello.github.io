I saw that my Windows Update was taking an awfully long time to download and install some updates so I checked what it was downloading. <br />

That's just insane. No wonder internet is slow today: all the PCs with VS2005 in our office must be downloading the same <strong>249MB </strong>patch! The <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=294de390-3c94-49fb-a014-9a38580e64cb&displaylang=en" title="Visual Studio 2008 Service Pack 1 ATL Security Update">patch for Visual Studio 2008 SP1 </a> is even bigger: <strong>365MB</strong>
