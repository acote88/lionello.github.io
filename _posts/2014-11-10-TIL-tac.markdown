<blockquote>tac<br />
<br />
Concatenate and write files in reverse, copies each FILE ( - means standard input), or standard input if none are given, to standard output, reversing the records (lines by default) in each file separately.</blockquote><br />
OSX doesn't have <strong>tac</strong> out of the box, but add the following line to your <strong>.bash_profile</strong> and you're good to go:<blockquote>alias tac='tail -r'</blockquote>
