It seems there's some truth in this quote from Futurama's Fry.<br />
<br />
According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye#Equivalent_resolution" title="Equivalent resolution">this article</a> the human eye has a resolution of 1,6 arc minute for a line pair. That is, two lines at a distance can be seen as distinct lines when the angle (between the two rays that go from the eye to each line) is not smaller than 1,6 arc minute.<br />
<br />
Let's say that those two lines correspond to 2 pixels (I'd have to say 3, black white black, but the article takes 2). That would mean that 1 eye-pixel is about 0,8 arc minute or 0,013 degrees.<br />
<br />
Now take your average HDTV, 30" diagonal, 1366x768 resolution. Using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem" title="Pythagorean theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a> this works out to a pixel size of about 0,5mm.<br />
<br />
What would be the ideal distance at which to put this TV?<br />
<br />
Now using some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometry#Overview" title="Trigonometry">trigonometry</a>, Tan(angle) = opposite/adjacent. opposite is our pixel, 0,5mm; adjacent is the distance between us and the TV, which is what we want to know.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Distance to TV = pixel size / Tan(pixel angle) = 0,5mm / Tan(0,013) = ~2203mm.</blockquote><br />
<br />
Conclusion: do <em>not </em>put your HDTV at a distance of more than 2,2m!
