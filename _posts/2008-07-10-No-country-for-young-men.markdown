<a href="http://www.tnr.com/story_print.html?id=06d65840-0997-482e-a84d-b09b61a7b0e5">book review of Mara Hvistendahl's "The New Republic"</a>

Some quotes:
"The red characters painted on village walls throughout the countryside have evolved from the 1980s slogan YOU BEAT IT OUT! YOU CAN MAKE IT FALL OUT! YOU CAN ABORT IT! BUT YOU CANNOT GIVE BIRTH TO IT!"

"The macho violence spurting forth through outlets like war games is a growing trend in Chinese society--and China's one-child policy, in effect since 1979, is partly responsible."

"If they're ugly and can't find work, there's nothing I can do. No one wants them."
