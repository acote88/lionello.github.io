<strong>UPDATE:</strong> it finished downloading in ~8,5 hours.<br />
<br />
<strong>UPDATE2:</strong> installing (upgrade) took ~5 hours. Normally I prefer to do a clean install, but I really didn't feel like spending the upcoming weekend hunting for latest versions and reinstalling all my software. I've heard good things about the Windows 7 upgrade option so I thought I'd test that first. I can always choose to reinstall later. Indeed, so far so good, since I'm writing this using Windows 7, but my first problem: quick launch is gone! I added it as a toolbar in the task bar, but know it shows up on the right, instead of the left.
