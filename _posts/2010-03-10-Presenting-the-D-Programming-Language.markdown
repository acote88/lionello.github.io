I'll be presenting the D Programming Language at the next monthly BLUG meeting. It'll mostly be for people who haven't heard of D yet. There'll be a fair chunk of D1 in there, but I'm hoping to touch some of D2's new features as well.<br />
<br />
These meetings are free for everyone to attend, so come by if you live in Beijing, or you happen to be there.<br />
