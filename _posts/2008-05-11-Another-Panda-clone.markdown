I saw the <a href="http://www.changheauto.com/" title="ChangHe Auto">ChangHe</a> <a href="http://www.chideal.com/" title="爱迪尔">Ideal</a> parked in front of our block today. I wonder what it costs.

<strong>EDIT: </strong>Some more info. Apparently it was designed by Bertone and it's being built with Suzuki. A new one costs around ~5500 euro, if I'm not mistaken.
