A few days ago I've moved to Shanghai and, since using a Beijing phone number in Shanghai is expensive, I decided to get a new phone number. I've decided to go with <a href="http://www.chinaunicom.com.cn/" title="China Unicom (CN)">China Unicom</a>, because their 3G standard is the same as the rest of the world's, so now I finally have 3G! (Although, youtube is still blocked, but at least Android 2.1 supports VPN now.)<br />
<br />
To get my new Shanghai phone number, add 3410941632 to my old phone number <img src="http://www.lunesu.com/templates/default/img/emoticons/wink.png" alt=";-)" style="display: inline; vertical-align: bottom;" class="emoticon" />
