Like most peoples, Chinese are very proud of their customs:
{% highlight sh %}
"...shaving your baby’s hair to make a calligraphy brush; and when she turns a year old, having her grab an object from a selection of different items (i.e. a pen, coins, an official seal and toys) in a ceremony known as zhua zhou (抓周) to help eager parents foresee their child’s future career path."
{% endhighlight %}
Apart from making a brush out of the hair, this ritual is eerily similar to "taierea motului" in Romania. And this is just one example of many customs that are considered unique.

<em>Traditional food</em> suffers from the same problem. About a month ago a Chinese colleague of mine invited me to have some traditional Chinese food. It consisted of a soup made with bread (not soup in a bread bowl, but just bread as an ingredient). This soup was not unlike <a href="http://www.festivalcineitalien.com/2007/boletino%2007/48009.jpg" title="Zuppa Gallurese">Zuppa Gallurese</a>, a traditional Sardinian dish. After the soup came some "bread, stuffed with mutton". Again, this traditional Chinese dish turned out to be very similar to Shoarma (or <em>Shaorma</em>, or, I kid you not, I've even seen it spelled <em>Shawarma</em>).

How can people be proud of <em>anything</em>? The more you travel, the more it turns out we're all the same.
