...that the <a href="http://www.olympicvideogames.com/en/index.html" title="Beijing 2008 - The Game">the official Beijing 2008 game</a> is not available in mainland China.

I've been trying to find out where I can buy an Xbox 360 or a Playstation 3, but it seems that ones that are being sold in China are 'imported' from Hong Kong. Imagine how silly I feel for not having brought one from Hong Kong <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/ivanzeeland/HongKong" title="Hong Kong">two weeks ago</a>.

And what's even more odd: <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/aug2005/id20050816_595546.htm" title="Xbox 360 made in China">the Xbox 360 is actually being produced in China</a>.
