China's official Xinhua news agency is declaring <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/13/content_8155267.htm" title="China's war on strong earthquake">war on strong earthquake</a>! But with the <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-05/13/content_8155677.htm" title="Xinhua">death toll nearing 10.000</a>, winning the war on strong earthquakes would save more lives than the war on terror would. (In fact, has that last one managed to save <em>one </em>life?)

<strong>EDIT:</strong> owwww, the <em>War on strong earthquake</em> banner was removed. I'll get if from my browser cache and post it here later..... Here:
