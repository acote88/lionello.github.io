Bought this nice 1TB Buffalo NAS and Windows 7 keeps nagging me to set up a backup schedule so I thought: cool, backup to the NAS! No:<br />
<blockquote>You can only save your backups on a network location on Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, and Windows 7 Enterprise.</blockquote><br />
Crap. Is this really a "professional" feature? I mean, every family has a HomeGroup/Workgroup by now. Networks are hardly Professional feature anymore. What this means is that there's no way I can get Windows 7 to make backups without intervention, since the only backup destinations supported in Home Premium are ones that need me to insert/connect, ie. CDs and USB-keys.
