We went to the zoo yesterday, where I saw my first real Panda. I don't know what I was expecting, but I left rather disappointed. Perhaps because they're not as cuddly as they make us believe? The aquarium was much nicer and satisfactory and it had at least 100 samples of every species present. The tanks seemed rather crowded, not unlike Beijing I suppose.<br />
